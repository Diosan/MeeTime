<p><strong>Blood Sugar:</strong> Talk to your doctor about when and how often you should be monitoring your blood sugar.</p>
 
<p>Your doctor may suggest blood sugar testing when you wake up in the morning; before eating breakfast and before or after eating lunch and dinner.</p>
 
<p>A good routine may be testing blood sugar three days a week; Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for e.g. On each day 1st thing in the morning to get your fasting Blood sugar and 1-2 hours after your biggest meal, which is usually lunch to gauge the blood sugar spike experienced from your favorite meals.</p>

<p><strong>Weight:</strong> A healthy diet and regular exercise are very important when maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Weight management is key in the preventative fight against chronic lifestyle diseases like Obesity, Diabetes, Heart Disease, High Blood Pressure and even Cancer. Tracking your weight (loss or gain) gives you the benefit of ensuring that you stay on top of your lifestyle goals. When you enter your weight periodically, your progress over time will be shown via a graph, providing you, your fitness coach and or health provider with key insights to adjust or include special Diets, Supplements and or Training Programs.</p>
